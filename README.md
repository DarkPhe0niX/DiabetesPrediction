This project is a machine learning-based system developed to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on key health indicators. The model was trained using a structured dataset available with this repo, which contains relevant medical features such as:

Glucose level
Blood pressure
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Insulin levels
Age
Number of pregnancies
Skin thickness

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing/zero values, normalized features, and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Model Training: Built and compared models using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and optionally Streamlit/Flask for deployment.
The model can be used in healthcare settings for early diagnosis and intervention planning, supporting better patient outcomes through predictive analytics.
